Ode to the Most Holy Sacrament of the Altar
Gabriel Garcia Lorca
**Exposition**
The women were singing by the spiked wall,  
All-Powerful God, when I saw you  
alive in the Sacrament, vibrant, naked,  
like a boy running from seven capital bulls.  

You, my God, alive inside the monstrance.  
Pierced by your Father’s needles of fire.  
Beating like the poor heart of a frog  
kept in a glass container by the doctors.  

Oh stone of loneliness where the grass moans  
and the dark water forfeits its three accents,  
they lift your column of spikenard under snow  
above the turning world of wheel and phallus.  

I watched while your delicious form floated  
on the annointed wound and the death cloth.  
I narrowed my eyes to hit it: sweet bull’s-eye  
of insomnia without a black bird.  

Anchored God, this is the way I want you.  
Small flour tambourine for the newborn child.  
Breath of wind and matter exactly joined  
for love of the flesh that doesn’t know your name.  

Like this, concise form of ineffable murmurs,  
swaddling-clothed God, tiny eternal Christ,  
said a thousand times, who died, crucified  
by the impure words of sweating men.  

The women were singing in the aimless sands  
when I saw your presence above your Sacrament.  
Five hundred brilliant, inky seraphim  
tasted your grapes in the neutral dome.  

Oh, most holy Form, vertex of flowers,  
where each angle takes its own fixed light,  
where number and mouth build this laid-out body  
of human light and muscles of flour.  

Oh, Form whose limits express the concrete  
multitude of lights and heard cries!  
Oh, snow surrounded by icebergs of music!  
Oh, flame crackling over all our veins!  

**World**  
A night of rooftops and soles of the feet  
was whistling through the dry eyes of doves.  
Fleeing glass and seaweed turn to wet silver  
the cement shoulders of the cities.  

The razor rested on the dressing tables,  
waiting impatiently to section necks.  
Children were chasing a sand serpent  
in a dark corner of the dead man’s house.  

The scribes fast asleep on the fourteenth floor.  
The prostitute with her breasts of scratched glass.  
Cables and half moon with insect tremors.  
Empty taverns. Screams. Heads in the water.  

In order to murder the nightingale,  
three thousand men came, armed with shining knives.  
Old women and priests cried while fighting off  
a cloudburst of tongues and flying ants.  

White-faced night. Non-night without a face.  
Under sun and moon. Sad night of the world.  
Opposing halves and a man who does not know  
when his butterfly will leave the clocks.  

There is a child under the dragon’s wings.  
Ponies of cadmium by the bloodless star.  
The unicorn wants what the rose forgets,  
and the bird seeks what the waters have banned.  

Only your Sacrament of balanced light  
quieted the anguish of unbound love.  
Only your Sacrament, manometer  
that saves hearts hurled at five hundred miles an hour.  

For your sign is the key to the starry plain  
where the card and wound are entwined in song,  
where the light pours out its resplendent bull  
and the scent of the warm rose grows strong.  

Your sign expresses the breeze and the worm.  
Junction where the age and the moment call.  
Clear orb of the dead, anthill of the living,  
with the man of the snows and the black of the flame.  

World, now there’s a goal for your helplessness.  
For your perennial horror of black holes.  
Oh, captive Lamb of three equal voices!  
Changeless Sacrament of love and discipline!  

**Devil**  
The deep blinding light of crackling matter,  
the sword’s slanting light, and the star’s mercury  
proclaimed the loveless body’s arrival  
on all the corners of the open Sunday.  

Beauty’s form without nostalgia or dream.  
Murmur of crazy surfaces set free.  
The present’s marrow. False sense of safety:  
to float on water with a marble torso.  

Beauty’s body throbs and makes its escape.  
A moment of veins and navel’s tenderness.  
Beauty chained with no blossoming line or center,  
no pure relations of number and smile.  

See him arrive, east for the groping hand.  
Gale winds and young man with curls and mollusks.  
Fire for sensitive flesh consumed by fire.  
Chrome for the sob that flies in search of God.  

The clouds were casting crocodile shadows  
on a colorless sky beaten by motors.  
High gray corners and letters in flames  
betrayed the beautiful enemy’s tents.  

It’s not naked women, hard teenagers,  
or the heart pierced by kisses and lancets.  
It’s not owning every horse in the world,  
or finding the moon’s musical haunches.  

So, what is the enemy’s secret charm?  
To survive. To command the flash of light.  
To fasten ourselves to his sad beauty  
and avoid the innocence of spring water.  

Let the shapely contours of the black bull  
and his instant, shameless faith in no tomorrow  
answer the new bleating, the drifting flower,  
and the trackless breasts of the sleeping nun.  

To vanquish the strong flesh of the enemy,  
prodigious magician of fires and colors,  
you offer your divine body and blood  
in this definite Sacrament that I sing.  

You descend into matter to appear  
to the eyes that observe your renewed life,  
vanquishing, in simple unity, swordless,  
the beautiful enemy’s thousand facets.  

Most joyful God! Most joyful Form!  
New alleluia of each and every day.  
Such a simple mystery of reason or dream,  
if the rose’s visible beauty is simple.  

Alleluia, alleluia of shoe and snow.  
Pure acanthus dawn in the unfinished hand.  
Alleluia, alleluia of point and standard  
over the four unsporting winds.  

Your Sacrament scatters seeds of joy  
against the Devil’s buckshot of pain,  
and in the barren valley of light and pure stone,  
the flute’s needle breaks an angel of glass.  

**Flesh**  
    How handsome you are,  
    heavenly gallant,  
    for gallants are always  
    removing their capes.  
    —Lope de Vega, Auto de los cantares  

In the name of the Father, rock, light, and ferment.  
In the name of the Son, flower, and spilled blood,  
in the visible fire of the Holy Spirit,  
Eve burns her own apple-stained fingers.  

Eve, gray and streaked with torn crimson,  
covered with honey and buzzing insects.  
Eve of jugulars and dripping moss,  
in the first sluggish impulse of the planets.  

The fig trees with their hot flowers  
were destroying the white walls of discipline.  
The woodsman’s axe gave the wind’s standards  
to the pure dynamo nailed in its martyrdom.  

Threads and nerves trembled in the moon’s fragrant  
phase, and in the womb found by the scalpel.  
On the satin couch, the lovers compress  
warm cotton swabs where their bones are sleeping.  

Look at that galloping horse! Look at it  
on the shoulders and breast of the girl taking shape!  
Look what tender sighs and moving sound  
press upon the waist of the bundled youth!  

Come, come and watch the veins uncoiling  
to bite the lunar caiman’s cockscomb  
while the green blood of Sodom glows  
in the parlor of a stiff aluminum heart.  

The tears must flow from the armpit,  
the hand should remember soft nocturnal rubber.  
The rhythms of systole and diastole  
should cloud the inhuman blush of the sky.  

In their whitest place, they have death’s little eggs  
(tiny red berries of invisible arsenic)  
that wither and destroy the nerve of pure light  
where the soul filters a lesson of kiss and wing.  

It’s your body, gallant, your mouth, your waist,  
the taste of your blood through frozen teeth.  
It’s your vanquished flesh, broken, trampled,  
that defeats and dazzles our own flesh.  

It’s the stiff emptiness of all that drifts freely,  
full of concrete and final roses.  
Adam is light, waiting under the rotten arch  
for the two girls of blood who beat in his temples.  

Oh, Body of Christ! Oh, Body of absolute silence,  
where the swan burns and the leper shines!  
Oh blank, sleepless Form!  
Angels and dogs barking against the whisper of veins.
