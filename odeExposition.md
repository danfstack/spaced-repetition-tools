Ode to the Most Holy Sacrament of the Altar (Exposition)
Federico García Lorca
The women were singing by the spiked wall,  
All-Powerful God, when I saw you  
alive in the Sacrament, vibrant, naked,  
like a boy running from seven capital bulls.  
You, my God, alive inside the monstrance.  
Pierced by your Father’s needles of fire.  
Beating like the poor heart of a frog  
kept in a glass container by the doctors.  
Oh stone of loneliness where the grass moans  
and the dark water forfeits its three accents,  
they lift your column of spikenard under snow  
above the turning world of wheel and phallus.  
I watched while your delicious form floated  
on the annointed wound and the death cloth.  
I narrowed my eyes to hit it: sweet bull’s-eye  
of insomnia without a black bird.  
Anchored God, this is the way I want you.  
Small flour tambourine for the newborn child.  
Breath of wind and matter exactly joined  
for love of the flesh that doesn’t know your name.  
Like this, concise form of ineffable murmurs,  
swaddling-clothed God, tiny eternal Christ,  
said a thousand times, who died, crucified  
by the impure words of sweating men.  
The women were singing in the aimless sands  
when I saw your presence above your Sacrament.  
Five hundred brilliant, inky seraphim  
tasted your grapes in the neutral dome.  
Oh, most holy Form, vertex of flowers,  
where each angle takes its own fixed light,  
where number and mouth build this laid-out body  
of human light and muscles of flour.  
Oh, Form whose limits express the concrete  
multitude of lights and heard cries!  
Oh, snow surrounded by icebergs of music!  
Oh, flame crackling over all our veins!
