Ode to the Most Holy Sacrament of the Altar (World)
Federico García Lorca
A night of rooftops and soles of the feet  
was whistling through the dry eyes of doves.  
Fleeing glass and seaweed turn to wet silver  
the cement shoulders of the cities.  
The razor rested on the dressing tables,  
waiting impatiently to section necks.  
Children were chasing a sand serpent  
in a dark corner of the dead man’s house.  
The scribes fast asleep on the fourteenth floor.  
The prostitute with her breasts of scratched glass.  
Cables and half moon with insect tremors.  
Empty taverns. Screams. Heads in the water.  
In order to murder the nightingale,  
three thousand men came, armed with shining knives.  
Old women and priests cried while fighting off  
a cloudburst of tongues and flying ants.  
White-faced night. Non-night without a face.  
Under sun and moon. Sad night of the world.  
Opposing halves and a man who does not know  
when his butterfly will leave the clocks.  
There is a child under the dragon’s wings.  
Ponies of cadmium by the bloodless star.  
The unicorn wants what the rose forgets,  
and the bird seeks what the waters have banned.  
Only your Sacrament of balanced light  
quieted the anguish of unbound love.  
Only your Sacrament, manometer  
that saves hearts hurled at five hundred miles an hour.  
For your sign is the key to the starry plain  
where the card and wound are entwined in song,  
where the light pours out its resplendent bull  
and the scent of the warm rose grows strong.  
Your sign expresses the breeze and the worm.  
Junction where the age and the moment call.  
Clear orb of the dead, anthill of the living,  
with the man of the snows and the black of the flame.  
World, now there’s a goal for your helplessness.  
For your perennial horror of black holes.  
Oh, captive Lamb of three equal voices!  
Changeless Sacrament of love and discipline!
