Ode to the Most Holy Sacrament of the Altar (Devil)
Federico García Lorca
The deep blinding light of crackling matter,  
the sword’s slanting light, and the star’s mercury  
proclaimed the loveless body’s arrival  
on all the corners of the open Sunday.  
Beauty’s form without nostalgia or dream.  
Murmur of crazy surfaces set free.  
The present’s marrow. False sense of safety:  
to float on water with a marble torso.  
Beauty’s body throbs and makes its escape.  
A moment of veins and navel’s tenderness.  
Beauty chained with no blossoming line or center,  
no pure relations of number and smile.  
See him arrive, east for the groping hand.  
Gale winds and young man with curls and mollusks.  
Fire for sensitive flesh consumed by fire.  
Chrome for the sob that flies in search of God.  
The clouds were casting crocodile shadows  
on a colorless sky beaten by motors.  
High gray corners and letters in flames  
betrayed the beautiful enemy’s tents.  
It’s not naked women, hard teenagers,  
or the heart pierced by kisses and lancets.  
It’s not owning every horse in the world,  
or finding the moon’s musical haunches.  
So, what is the enemy’s secret charm?  
To survive. To command the flash of light.  
To fasten ourselves to his sad beauty  
and avoid the innocence of spring water.  
Let the shapely contours of the black bull  
and his instant, shameless faith in no tomorrow  
answer the new bleating, the drifting flower,  
and the trackless breasts of the sleeping nun.  
To vanquish the strong flesh of the enemy,  
prodigious magician of fires and colors,  
you offer your divine body and blood  
in this definite Sacrament that I sing.  
You descend into matter to appear  
to the eyes that observe your renewed life,  
vanquishing, in simple unity, swordless,  
the beautiful enemy’s thousand facets.  
Most joyful God! Most joyful Form!  
New alleluia of each and every day.  
Such a simple mystery of reason or dream,  
if the rose’s visible beauty is simple.  
Alleluia, alleluia of shoe and snow.  
Pure acanthus dawn in the unfinished hand.  
Alleluia, alleluia of point and standard  
over the four unsporting winds.  
Your Sacrament scatters seeds of joy  
against the Devil’s buckshot of pain,  
and in the barren valley of light and pure stone,  
the flute’s needle breaks an angel of glass.
