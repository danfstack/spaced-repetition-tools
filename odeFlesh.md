Ode to the Most Holy Sacrament of the Altar (Flesh)
Federico García Lorca
    How handsome you are,  
    heavenly gallant,  
    for gallants are always  
    removing their capes.  
    —Lope de Vega, Auto de los cantares  
In the name of the Father, rock, light, and ferment.  
In the name of the Son, flower, and spilled blood,  
in the visible fire of the Holy Spirit,  
Eve burns her own apple-stained fingers.  
Eve, gray and streaked with torn crimson,  
covered with honey and buzzing insects.  
Eve of jugulars and dripping moss,  
in the first sluggish impulse of the planets.  
The fig trees with their hot flowers  
were destroying the white walls of discipline.  
The woodsman’s axe gave the wind’s standards  
to the pure dynamo nailed in its martyrdom.  
Threads and nerves trembled in the moon’s fragrant  
phase, and in the womb found by the scalpel.  
On the satin couch, the lovers compress  
warm cotton swabs where their bones are sleeping.  
Look at that galloping horse! Look at it  
on the shoulders and breast of the girl taking shape!  
Look what tender sighs and moving sound  
press upon the waist of the bundled youth!  
Come, come and watch the veins uncoiling  
to bite the lunar caiman’s cockscomb  
while the green blood of Sodom glows  
in the parlor of a stiff aluminum heart.  
The tears must flow from the armpit,  
the hand should remember soft nocturnal rubber.  
The rhythms of systole and diastole  
should cloud the inhuman blush of the sky.  
In their whitest place, they have death’s little eggs  
(tiny red berries of invisible arsenic)  
that wither and destroy the nerve of pure light  
where the soul filters a lesson of kiss and wing.  
It’s your body, gallant, your mouth, your waist,  
the taste of your blood through frozen teeth.  
It’s your vanquished flesh, broken, trampled,  
that defeats and dazzles our own flesh.  
It’s the stiff emptiness of all that drifts freely,  
full of concrete and final roses.  
Adam is light, waiting under the rotten arch  
for the two girls of blood who beat in his temples.  
Oh, Body of Christ! Oh, Body of absolute silence,  
where the swan burns and the leper shines!  
Oh blank, sleepless Form!  
Angels and dogs barking against the whisper of veins.
